            <p>Transition to professional College life is a major change for most of the students as many aspects are
                new and different. There are many new, more responsibilities to be handled alone at academic and
                personal fronts. There are issues like academic pressures, social and interpersonal concerns that may
                result into feeling of loneliness, fear of failure, competitive, financial pressure, anxiety, and stress
                and anger that impact one's confidence etc.</p>
            <p>These concerns need to be ventilated and to be heard by a trusted, friendly, experienced and mature
                counsellors. Counselling can help students handle these pressures and our students need to understand
                the need for these learning interventions. We all need help at different points in time. Please seek
                help for many a things we can't handle alone.</p>

                life's challenges and ensure peace of mind.</p>
