          <h3>Who needs Counselling?</h3>
          <p>
            It is a common myth that, Counselling is only for people who are
            very disturbed. In fact, counselling can be helpful for any person,
            who can think, feel and behave appropriately most of the times but
            sometimes, may require help to enhance, develop, change or improve
            his/her condition. Students, working professionals, parents may seek
            counselling for different issues.

          <h3>How long is the process of counselling?</h3>
          <p>
            Counselling is a continuous process, based on your needs and goals.
            Typically it could last anywhere between 4-20 sessions. Counsellor
            and client decide together about the time of appointment and the no.
            of sessions. Usually they are 40 minutes sessions, on a weekly
            basis.

          <h3>Will the information I share be kept as a secret?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. All information that you share will be kept confidential. This
            is an extremely important ethical guideline for a counsellor where
            no information can be disclosed to another person without your
            consent. Therefore you can be confident that what you share will be
            kept as a secret, except in situations where there is risk of
            self-harm, harm to others or child abuse.

          <h3>How long will I need to come for Counselling?</h3>
          <p>
            The duration of the Counselling process differs for each individual.
            It depends on the complexity of the concerns that the individual has
            and his/her participation in the process. On an average, counselling
            sessions can extend between 2-6 sessions.

          <h3>Does my problem have to be a serious one to see a Counsellor?</h3>
          <p>
            Anything that is bothering and distressing for you is serious enough
            for us. So do not worry about whether your problem is serious enough
            to seeking counselling. Many students seek help for their personal,
            relational, familial, and academic as well as identity related
            concerns such as those related to being a gender-sexual minority,
            religious minority and so on. Seeing a Counsellor is about making a
            positive choice to get the help that you need. And the sooner you do
            that the better, when something is relatively minor, so that it can
            be resolved quickly and not grow into a more serious concern.

            counselling center maintains records of the clients seeking service
            of the center. Counsellor make notes about sessions. All
